Why to fork
-----------

Here is the features I needed in my pet project:

- Dynamic library instead of executive file

- Hash a raw RGBA values array, not file

- As few dependencies as possible

- Proper signature declarations for P/Invoke

I've read the code and found it's pretty easy to achieve.
